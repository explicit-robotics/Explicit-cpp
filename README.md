# Expplicit-cpp
This repository contains Exp[licit]-cpp -- a software to control robots via C++. For now, only the LBR iiwa R820 (iiwa14) is supported. Other robots will be supported soon. 

The current version is in active development, i.e., might be unstable. A formal announcement will be made once the first stable version of Exp[licit]-cpp is complete. For vector and matrix calculations, we use [Eigen version 3.4.0](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases/3.4.0), which is added as a git submodule.
