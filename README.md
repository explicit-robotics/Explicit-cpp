# Explicit-cpp
Explicit written in C++. Currently, iiwa14 is only included. 
There is also a version with MATLAB, called [Explicit-MATLAB](https://github.com/explicit-robotics/Explicit-MATLAB).

Explicit-cpp is in active development, i.e., unstable. A formal announcement will be made once the first stable version of Explicit-cpp is complete.

Explicit-cpp uses [Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). We use [Eigen version 3.4.0](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases/3.4.0) and is added as a git submodule.
