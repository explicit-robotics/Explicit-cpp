# Explicit-cpp
Explicit written in C++. Currently, iiwa14 is only included. 
There is also a version with MATLAB, called [Explicit-MATLAB](https://github.com/explicit-robotics/Explicit-MATLAB).

Explicit-cpp is in active development, i.e., unstable. A formal announcement will be made once the first stable version of Explicit-cpp is complete.

To use Explicit-cpp locally, one should download (not install!) [Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). In detail:
[1] Visit the [Eigen website](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
[2] Install the latest stable release, especially [Eigen 3.4.0.](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip)
[3] Unzip the folder here as a name "Eigen". Then you are all set!

One can also use Explicit-cpp with the FRI application to control the robot.
